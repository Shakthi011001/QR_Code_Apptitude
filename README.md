Hello , this is Shakthi and this is project helps solve the problems statement of Scanning and 
generating QR codes. So the project basically revolves around the package:barcode_scan/barcode_scan.dart
which enables us with the qr scanning feature. So we have 4 different dart files that enable us to make this project 
happen.'main.dart' is the main program of the project and Homepage.dart file is used to create the splash
screen with two button 'Scan qr code' and 'generate qr code' , so clicking on either of the button 
will navigate to their respective files 'scanpage.dart' and 'generatepage.dart' which is been 
integrated to the buttons.So when we press the 'open qr scanner' we get the scanner and we can view
the results once the qr gets scanned and if you wanna generate a qr code for a link or even a string
we use 'generate qr code' button which enables us to navigate to the qr code generator screen. The difficulties that
I faced was to to generate the result of the barcode that has been scanned to be printed back in the result page.
The one best part about particpating in the app is to know that you aren't the only app developer out here,
there are many people and you hsould keep pushing yourself to ultimately coem out as the better version of 
yourself.
